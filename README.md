## Pre-trained Models 
You can download our pre-trained model from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m3t15rWw76IDDWJ0exLOe5P0uEnjk3zl?usp=drive_link) and [[Baidu Yun (extracted code:cjzk)]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fPLVgnZbdY1n75Flq54bMQ)

## How to train?
You need to modify ```datasets/dataset.py``` slightly for your environment, and then
```
python train.py  
```

## How to test?
```
python evaluate.py
```
